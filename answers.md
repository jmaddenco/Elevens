1) A deck is defined as being made up of a group of cards, they are seperate objects however deck is made up of other objects. They are related to each other because a Deck has a card.

2) 6 cards, a jack queen and king of each suit red and blue.

3)you need to create ranks, suits, and pointValues with a  length of 52. Ranks contains 4 1's, 4 2's, 4 3's - and so on through the whole set of cards - up to 4 Ace's. Suits contains 13 of each of the 4 types of cards (Hearts, Spades, Clubs, Diamonds).

4)When the program loops through the arrays, it bases it off the order that is passed in, so the cards will not be correctly formatted, so yes it does matter.
